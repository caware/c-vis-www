<h2>Raw Data</h2>

<p>The data used by the visualisation tool is directly available for download at <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/meters/elec/">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/meters/elec/</a>.</p>

<p>The data is organised in a directory structure which mimics the electricity distribution tree. A given directory may have data files and/or subdirectories.</p>

<p>There are data files with 2 minute time series (one per day) and with hourly time series (one per month). Thus for example:</p>

<p>http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/meters/elec/primary-cs1-riser/F-lighting/</p>

<p>is a directory that contains the reading for the lighting circuit on the First floor that
comes off the CS1 riser.  The data files in that directory are of the form</p>

<p>S-m23-yyyy-mm-dd.json (for the 2 minute time series)</p>
<p>S-m23-yyyy-mm,json (for the 1 hour time series.)</p>

<p>If one looks inside any of the data files once can discern that the data is concerned with
lighting on the First floor in the North section of the building.</p>

<p>Data files are in JavaScript Object Notation {http://www.json.org/} (json).  This
is so that the files can be easily manipulated in JavaScript.  Indeed our visualisation tools
are built on top of JavaScript packages that do most of the heavy lifting.  We will supply
some very simple code to help you get started if you want to perform any analysis
of the data.  (Or you can always look at the source of the tool itself - after all you download
it to run it...)</p>

<p>Each file contains a small number of descriptive tagged values and a substantial time series
whose pairs are a timestamp and an average power in kilowatts for that interval. A JavaScript
time stamp is epoch milliseconds since 1 Jan 1970.</p>

<p>More tags will be added in the future.  Current tags include:</p>

<ul>
<li>label:  ??</li>
<li>path: the directory to which the data file belongs</li>
<li>description: an indication of what the electricity is used for, eg lighting, sockets, air conditioning...</li>
<li>room: where the meter is located</li>
<li>coverage: what physical area the electricity is used in</li>
<li>type: the type of meter from which the data was obtained</li>
<li>ts: ???</li>
</ul>

<p>We frequently regenerate the published data from the \textit{real} raw data so new tags
will be added to old time series, (and old ones may disappear - although at some point
we will commit to backwards compatibility)</p>
